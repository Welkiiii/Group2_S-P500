# S&P 500 Company Growth Classification 

## Project Background
In today's volatile markets, identifying companies with high growth potential is critical for investors and policymakers. This project leverages machine learning to classify S&P 500 companies into `growth categories` based on their financial and operational characteristics. The insights can support:
- ​**Investment decisions**​ (identifying high-growth stocks)
- ​**Economic trend analysis**​ (sector/region performance)
- ​**Corporate benchmarking**​ (comparing against peers)
