# üìâS&P 500 Company Growth Classification 

## üöÄProject Background
In today's volatile markets, identifying companies with high growth potential is critical for investors and policymakers. This project leverages machine learning to classify S&P 500 companies intov **`growth categories`** based on their financial and operational characteristics. The insights can support:
- ‚Äã**Investment decisions**‚Äã (identifying high-growth stocks)
- ‚Äã**Economic trend analysis**‚Äã (sector/region performance)
- ‚Äã**Corporate benchmarking**‚Äã (comparing against peers)

## üìöDataset: S&P 500 Companies
A comprehensive collection of financial and operational metrics for major US companies, with focus on technology sector constituents.

### üéØTarget Variable
**Revenue Growth**, our target variable, measures the percentage change in a company's revenue over a given period, reflecting financial performance. Analyzing its distribution among S&P 500 companies, we classified growth into five categories: `Declining` (negative growth), `Low Growth (0‚Äì5%)`, `Moderate Growth` (5‚Äì15%, largest segment at 33.9%), `High Growth` (15‚Äì30%), and `Hyper Growth` (>30%). This categorization highlights different levels of company performance, enabling focused analysis and strategic decision-making.

## üìå Project Brief Description

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to classify S&P 500 companies into predefined `revenue growth categories`  using financial and organizational features. The process includes:

### üîß Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

- Select features through `correlation annalysis`, `statistical significance testing`, and `feature importance analysis`
- Cleaned and standardized numerical fields (e.g., prices, employees)
- Applied `log-transformation` to handle skewed features
- Encoded high-cardinality categorical variables like `Industry` and `City` using **target encoding**
- Created derived features such as:
  - `Price per Employee`
  - `Capital Intensity`
  - `Is Expensive Stock` (binary flag)
  - `Industry-City Interaction` terms


### ü§ñ Model Training & Comparison

- Trained and evaluated the following models:
  - **Logistic Regression**
  - **Decision Tree**
  - **k-Nearest Neighbors**
  - **Naive Bayes**
  - **Random Forest**
  - **XGBoost**

- **Evaluation metrics**:
  - `Macro F1 Score`: to balance performance across classes
  - `ROC AUC (OvR)`: to assess multi-class probability calibration

### üîç Hyperparameter Tuning & Visualization

- Applied `GridSearchCV` to tune key hyperparameters (e.g., depth, learning rate, regularization)
- Visualized:
  - Model performance comparison (bar plots)
  - Confusion matrices
  - ROC AUC comparison
  - Grid search tuning curves

### ‚úÖ Key Findings

- **Random Forest** and **XGBoost** consistently outperformed simpler models
  - F1 Score ‚âà **0.38**
  - ROC AUC ‚âà **0.74**
- Results indicate **moderate predictive value** 
- Foundation is laid for future improvement through:
  - Feature enrichment (e.g., financial ratios, time-based trends)
  - Class balancing (SMOTE, class weights)
  - Ensemble blending (e.g., stacking models)
